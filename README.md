1) Demo

  

2)  Abstract

  The "BurgerShop" application aims to provide users with a simple and efficient platform to take advantage of the products found on the restaurant menu from the comfort of their home. Within this application, the specific functionalities of a food delivery application have been implemented, where users have access to different products such as burgers, drinks, fries and sauces. They can add the products shown in the menu to their order, as well as edit them according to their preferences. When placing an order, customers can manage the delivery address and payment options.
  
  The interface of the application allows users to track the status of the order until it is successfully delivered, so the application stands out for its complexity, where the user is connected with the interface throughout the delivery process.
